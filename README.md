# Spectres
a Blender add-on to implement few tools and a library (shaders + geometry nodes)

Among other things, this contains a portage of Inigo Quilez glsl library to Blender !<br>

### Intentions
- To provide a tool to facilitate the use of materials and nodes. 
- To develop a library among a group of students to respond to their needs, and provide them an easy access to this content
